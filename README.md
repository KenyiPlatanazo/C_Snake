If for any reason you landed on my project and you want to try it out, use the files inside the new_version directory.
If you want to compile it, just cd into said directory and write on the terminal:
clang -lSDL2 snake.c game.c -o game
Ignore the "test_gric.c" and "test.o" files, they're just that, test files.
